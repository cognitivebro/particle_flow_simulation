This model predicts the filitration effeciency of a nano-fiber mat or textile based on mechanical forces down to the nano scale.

In the main Python code I have seperated out blocks of code as I created it in Jupyter for continuity and debugging purposes.  If you have any questions about the model including what assumptions you should make, freel free to reach out.
